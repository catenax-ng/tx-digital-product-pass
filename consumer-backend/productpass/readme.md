# What is this backend app responsible for?

This backend includes the services and *logics* to manage the *passports* of the `frontend app`.

# Services Available

## Authentication Services
All Authenticated APIs required a `AccessToken` JWT Token generated by the login in the frontend or in the Catena-X Keycloak instance.

```yaml
{
    headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer <<AccessToken>>"
    }
}
```

For login and log out!
```bash
------
/auth/check #With this api you can check you authentication status.
------
/auth/token #Request token from the keycloak instance
------
```

## API Services

```bash
/api/data/catalog?providerUrl=<...> #Get all the catalog from the provider

------
/api/data/submodel/<assetId>?idType=<...>&index=<...>
__________
default idType = "Battery_ID_DMC_Code"
default index = 0

------

/api/data/passport?transferId=<...> #Get passport if the transferId is available -> No contract exchange is required if transferId exists

```

### Passport API

}
```

#### Versions Available

## OSS License Check

The third party library dependecies, utilized in this app have to  be approved from The Eclipse Foundation.

The [Dash Licence Tool](https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses) is used to scan the dependencies

[OSS License Checks with Dash & Compliance with Apache 2.0](https://confluence.catena-x.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=54989501)

At the time of writing this manual, the dependencies have status approved and therefore no need to generate  IP Team Review request further.

[Maven plugin](https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses/blob/master/README.md#maven-plugin-options) used to check OSS license

How to run:
```bash
mvn org.eclipse.dash:license-tool-plugin:license-check -Ddash.summary=DEPENDENCIES
```


## Swagger Docs

Swagger documentation is now automatically available at the following path:

```https://<host>/swagger-ui/index.html```

# Run the application

Use maven to run the spring boot application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

If you want to run the application in a different way checkout the [frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions) section below.

## Modify the configurations in the deployment files

You can use the default configuration to start the application:
```charts/digital-product-pass/values.yaml```

However if you need to change it just create a new environment with this naming convention: ```values-env`.yaml``` where ```env``` is the name of your environment. You can use as an example the following configuration file: ```charts/digital-product-pass/values-int.yaml```.

The configuration for the consumer backend application is a yaml file that is configured in the following tag: ```backend.application```. Before the application starts all the configuration parameters must be specified, since they are required for initialization and will be checked at the test fase.

Once you configured the application use the follow the [TL;DR](#tldr) below to ```build the image and start the application``` using helm charts.
