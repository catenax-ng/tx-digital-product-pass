## What is this backend app responsible for?

This backend includes the services and *logics* to manage the *passports* of the `frontend app`.

## Services Available

### Authentication Services
All Authenticated APIs required a `AccessToken` JWT Token generated by the login in the frontend or in the Catena-X Keycloak instance.

```yaml
{
    headers: {
        Authorization: "Bearer <<AccessToken>>"
    }
}
```

For login and log out!
```bash
------
\auth\check #With this api you can check you authentication status.
------
\auth\token #Request token from the keycloak instance
------
```

### API Services
>  **_NOTE:_** You must be authenticated with the keycloak instance to access this APIs


#### Data
Get data from Catena-X Services
```bash
\api\data\catalog?providerUrl=<...> #Get all the catalog from the provider

------
\api\data\submodel\<assetId>?idType=<...>&index=<...>
__________
default idType = "Battery_ID_DMC_Code"
default index = 0

------

\api\data\passport?transferId=<...> #Get passport if the transferId is available -> No contract exchange is required if transferId exists

```

#### Passport API

Get a passport from a Catena-X Provider by using its AssetId, this will start a negotiation with the provider and retrieve passport

```bash
\api\passport\<version>\<assetId>?idType=<...>&index=<...>
__________
default idType = "Battery_ID_DMC_Code"
default index = 0
```

##### Versions Available
The passport available versions are:
```bash
[ "v1" ] -> Battery Passport
```

To change the available versions add in the configurations for each environment ``

```yaml
passport:
    versions:
        - 'v1'
```

#### Contract API

Get a contract from the catalog searching by assetId
```bash
\api\contracts\<assetId>
```

### Public APIs

Public APIs don't require authentication
```bash
\health #Get the health status of the server
```
```json
{
    "message": "RUNNING",
    "status": 200,
    "data": "24/11/2022 17:48:18.487"
}

```
## Run the application

Use maven to run the spring boot application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```


### Available Environments
By default the application will start in development environment:
#### Development Environment
For the development environment include the following code:
```yaml
environmentCode: dev
```
#### Integration Environment
For the integration environment include the following code:
```yaml
environmentCode: int
```


#### Configuration of Environment
To configure the environment go to the following file ```src/main/resources/config/env.yml```
```yaml
environment: "int" # If empty will be selected the default environment

default:
    environment: "dev" # Default environment
    available: #Available environments
        - "dev"
        - "int"

```
#### Adding a new Environment
Let imagine you want to add the following environment code: `newEnvironmentCode`

> **_NOTE:_**: Environment codes **must** not have _spaces_ or _special characters_!

1. When a new environment is at the available list, a configuration file must be defined and added in the ```src/main/resources/application.yml```:

```yaml
spring:
    config:
        import: "application-dev.yml"

---

spring:
    config:
        activate:
            on-profile: "int"
        import: "application-int.yml"

---

spring:
    config:
        activate:
            on-profile: "<newEnvironmentCode>"
        import: "application-newEnvironmentCode.yml"

```

2. Add the following environmentCode to the ```src/main/resources/config/env.yml```

```yaml
default:
    environment: "dev" # Default environment
    available: #Available environments
        - "dev"
        - "int"
        - "newEnvironmentCode"
```

3. Configure the following files
    - Vault File:  `data/VaultConfig/vault.token-newEnvironmentCode.yml`
    - Application Configuration File: `src/main/resources/config/configuration-newEnvironmentCode.yml`
    - Spring Boot Configuration File: `src/main/resources/application-newEnvironmentCode.yml`

## OSS License Check
